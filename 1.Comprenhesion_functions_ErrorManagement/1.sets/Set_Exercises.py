def exercises_4():
    #4. Write a Python program to remove item(s) from a given set.

def exercises_5():
    #5. Write a Python program to remove an item from a set if it is present in the set.

def exercises_6():
    #6. Write a Python program to create an intersection of sets.

def exercises_7():
    #7. Write a Python program to create a union of sets.

def exercises_8():
    #8. Write a Python program to create set difference.

    #18. Write a Python program to check if a given set is a superset of itself and a superset of another given set.

def exercises_19():    
    #19. Write a Python program to find elements in a given set that are not in another set.

def exercises_20():    
    #20. Write a Python program to remove the intersection of a second set with a first set.

def exercises_21():
    #21. Write a search Python program to find all the unique words and count the frequency of occurrence from a given list of strings. Use Python set data type.

def exercises_27():
    #27. Write a Python program to find all the anagrams in a given list of strings and then group them together. Use the Python data type.

def exercises_28():
    #28. Write a Python program to find all the unique combinations of 3 numbers from a given list of numbers, adding up to a target number.
